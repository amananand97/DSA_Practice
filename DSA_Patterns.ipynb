    "The Cyclic Sort pattern is a technique used to solve problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range. It iterates over the array one number at a time and, if the current number is not at the correct index, swaps it with the number at its correct index. This approach avoids the O(n^2) complexity that would result from placing each number in its correct index individually.\n",
